# Adirondack 46ers

Within the Adirondack State Park, there are 46 peaks that are over 4000 feet tall. The title "46er" is awarded to anyone who has hiked all of these mountains.

This application provides a platform for keeping track of which peaks a user has climbed. A user can add a hike to his/her profile with a description of the experience.  The user can then edit or delete the description of the hike or the entire hike itself.
